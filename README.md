## The path I took to learn fullstack development
### First 6 months
---
1. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- Only did HTML and CSS sections
2. [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
- Skip jQuery
3. [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)
4. [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/)
5. [Advanced CSS and Sass](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)
6. [React: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)
7. [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/)
- Optional

### 6 - 12 months
---
1. [NodeJs - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/)
2. [MEAN stack guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/)
3. Learned GraphQL through [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8QAzbLcRglXeN_MY9blyw)
4. Learned TypeScript from starting to write all of my projects in it
5. Picked up testing with Jest by reading documentation
6. Styled components

### 12 - 18 months
---
1. NextJS
2. Learned Go and C# and how to integrate the two with React and Angular. For C# things are more complicated to integrate with React depending on how you want to do things, whereas it works with Angular out of the box
3. Got into monorepos with yarn workspaces and lerna
4. Started using Docker to containerize my applications and do CI/CD with CircleCI (Would recommend Github actions for CI/CD now)
5. At this point I had put in roughly 4000-5000 hours and could reverse engineer most websites, and for the ones I wasn't sure how to approach, I had the ability to figure it out relatively quickly

### 18 months and beyond
---
Mainly just improving what I already know at a fundamental level. So things like doing algorithms and data structures in JavaScript / TypeScript, and getting better with the technologies I already know.

### Advice For Someone who's just getting into learning it
---
1. Pick one language and stick with it until you've used it for thousands of hours. The more you hop from language to language the less progress you make and will ultimately be fruitless and a waste of your time for the most part. Get good with one language, then move on to others when you feel really comfortable with it.

2. Don't get stuck in tutorial hell, which is basically just doing tutorials over and over again without actually going in and building things yourself. You do most of your learning while building things, and while courses are great to help give you a theoretical / fundamental understanding of a technology, theory can only take you so far. My advice on this is to build something after each course you do on your own, and refer to the course material as a reference guide for whenever you get stuck. If all else fails just use Google, which leads me to my next point.

3. Knowing how to use Google to solve problems but not knowing what to Google for is something that you'll probably deal with for a while (maybe not if you're following the traditional education path, this is just from my own experience) and it's going to last until you start to think like a programmer. Ie: breaking things down into smaller components and getting good at debugging; which for debugging you'll just get better at with time, whereas learning the skill to break things down will come with time spent building things

4. If you get stuck on a problem and start to get frustrated, take a step back from the screen for 10-15 minutes or just go work on another project. There's this thing with human psychology where your brain is doing a lot of the problem solving in the background while you're not actively trying to figure it out. Sort of like how the brain is trying to figure a foreign language out if you go through with the immersion approach, except in this case its doing most of the work when you're not actively putting your time into it.

5. Last piece of advice is there's no one language that's better than every other one in every single way. Each language has its own quirks and is better than others in a certain domain. JavaScript for example is the king of the web currently and has been for a long time now, and while you can pretty much write anything with it (mobile apps, dekstop apps, servers, AI / Machine Learning) if I wanted to build a really performant app for mobile / desktop, you'd be better off using Kotlin or Swift for mobile, and something like C# for desktop apps. While most apps you write using JS will probably be fine with what it has to offer, its not always going to be the best thing to use for everything. Having said that, I write pretty much everything in TypeScript (superset of JavaScript) and everything works great, just depends on the case.
